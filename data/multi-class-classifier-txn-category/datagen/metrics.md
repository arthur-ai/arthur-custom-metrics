Multi-Label Precision Recall and F1 Score per Label,Tracks precision recall and F1 score for each spending category independently. Identifies which categories the model classifies well and which have systematic errors.
Multi-Label Classification Confusion Matrix Per Class,Tracks true positives false positives and false negatives per spending category. Reveals which categories are confused with each other (e.g. groceries misclassified as shopping).
Multi-Label Classification Count by Class Label,Counts how often each spending category appears in model predictions over time. Monitors predicted category distribution and detects drift in spending pattern predictions.
Label Coverage Ratio,Proportion of transactions predicted as each spending category over time. Tracks whether the model's category distribution matches expected spending patterns.
Average Confidence Score per Label,Average model softmax probability for each category across all inferences. Identifies categories where the model is systematically uncertain or overconfident.
